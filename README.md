# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
A collaboration between four students to complete a text based adventure style game for a class. This project acts as a means to practice creating professional level documentation for software, and to enlist common practices within the software development community. Some of the documentation includs UML diagrams, NLRs, use case diagrams, and much more all bundled into three seperate project releases, demonstrating our progress at that point in time. Currently, the project is still within it's second project release, meaning that development is still ongoing, and the game is not yet fully functional.
